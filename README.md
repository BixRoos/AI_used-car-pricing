# Project Title
Buy a used car as cheap as possible

## Summary
When buying your "new" used car you want it as cheap as possible. This project would be handy to use to make the best descision.
Building AI course project


## Background
The problem is often to come to a conclusion of what is the most reasonable price to pay for a used car. Some arguments for buying or not buying are very important and some are less important, especially when you put them in relation to each other.

This solution would probably help people that is not good at mathematics or conclusion makings and would be aplicable when ever a used car should be bought.
The solution would be interesting for those who is about to look after a (for them) new car to buy. And it would probably be an important toll to make it easier to make the final decision - should I buy the car or not. This should motivate anyone that want to do the best deal possible.


## How is it used?
The person who use this AI based tool to get help should leave some input to get a good result. For example you should specify:
- How many kilometers has the car gone so far?
- What is the price for the used car?
- What year was the car produced?
- What year and month was the first year in traffic?
- How common is the car on the market?
- What is the fuel consumption of the car, and The fuel price?
- What is the estimated service cost each year?
- What is the estimated value of the additional equipment in the car?
- The condition of the tires.
- The condition of the car.
- etc etc

The user should then insert as much information as possible of the above and the oUtput would give a rating between 1,00 - 10,00 how much value it would be to buy this specific car. A very bad car might result in having less score than 5,00 since a very valuable car to buy would get a score of at least 7,99.

## Data sources and AI methods
The data that´s needed is an input from the user where the figures should be as specific as possible and maybe some yes/no questions give extra score on the final result. The technique that could be used is for example Linear Regression. Nearest Neighbour is not very useful until you have quite alot of results for other calculations and scores that´s calculated.


## Challenges
The project does not solve the personal feeling of the specific car or if it is really as good as the advertisement says it it. You should probably get a test ride in the car to make the final descision.


## What next?
I belive that this project would be possible to do if a collaboration between a programmer and someone who knows a lot about cars did this together. It could be used for example on sites where you can buy used cars (or motorcycles etc).
